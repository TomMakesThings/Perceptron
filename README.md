# Perceptron
The aim of this project was to implement two variants of a perceptron from scratch to classify 10 binary inputs (xᵢ = +/-1) according to whether:
<ol type="I">
  <li>Their sum Σxᵢ is positive or negative</li>
  <li>The parity of the inputs ∏xᵢ, i.e. the sign of their product, is positive or negative</li>
</ol>
